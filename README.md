# QA_System_LLM_Project

This repository contains my first project exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) using **Google Palm** and **Langchain**. The goal of this project is to learn the basics of building a Question and Answer (Q&A) system for an e-learning company.  

## Key Concepts Learned  
- **LLM-based Q&A Systems**: How to use LLMs for answering questions.  
- **Langchain**: Basics of creating workflows for LLMs.  
- **Text Embeddings**: Understanding Huggingface embeddings for semantic search.  
- **Vector Databases (FAISS)**: Storing and querying data efficiently.  

## Usage  
This project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook.  
- Open the notebook `QA_System_Learning_Notebook.ipynb`.  
- Follow the steps to learn how a Q&A system works with LLMs.  

## Files  
- **`QA_System_Learning_Notebook.ipynb`**: Main notebook for learning.  
- **`faq_data.csv`**: Sample FAQ data used in the notebook.  

## Notes  
This project is for learning purposes and serves as a foundation for future projects in LLMs and AI.
